## Should I be doing Event Sourcing?

Event Sourcing is probably a good fit when you are:

- build rich object-oriented domain models (e.g. DDD) 
- have a lot of behaviour that isn't CRUD
- accountability/debugability is critical
- business derives value or competitive advantage from event data
- building a scaleable system based on the CQRS pattern
